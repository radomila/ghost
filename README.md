# Ghost

This mini-project was created by using HTML and SCSS. The main goal was to train my basic coding skills, enhance creativity and most importantly, learn the main concepts of SCSS.

## SCSS Concepts Used

### Variables

- All colors and sizes are stored as variables, which enables me to use them repeatedly throughout the stylesheet.
- Some variables are nested to avoid repeating the same value multiple times.
- Variables are descriptive according to their purpose and divided with dashes to separate words in multi-word names.

### Mixins

- Styles that need to be reused throughout the stylesheet are defined with mixins.
- Some of the mixins have multiple arguments in order to ensure the best possible reuse.

### Partials

- Code is divided into partials - separate files, which make code much cleaner and easier to manage.
- Separate partials are created for variables, mixins, and animations.
